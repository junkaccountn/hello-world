GitInstructions

set up your local directory using 
	cd 
	then the path to the folder you’ll be using
	this tells the computer what folder all the stuff you’ll be ‘comparing’ to
	in github

check back on how to set up log in and password on the CL

do a ls (mac) or dir (windows) to see what files are in the path

do a git status
	to compare files between git hub and your local computer

do a git close URL (from github)
	this will make a copy of your git hub repository to the current directory
	on your computer

make any changes on the computer files

do a git add filename
	this will upload from current directory to github
	not done yet though

do git commit -m “your commit message here”
	this includes your commit plus the commit message

do git push
	not entirely sure here but seems to finalize the process
