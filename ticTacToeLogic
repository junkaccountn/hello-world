When you get to it.

think of the tic tac toe as a grid with numbers on the top and letters along the side

if letters all = a a a & numbers are 1 2 3, win
	this will be a vertical win
if numbers all = 1 1 1 (or whatever) & letters = a b c, win
	this would be a horizontal win
if numbers = 1 2 3 & letters = a b c (or switch order)
	this equals a diagonal win
